```bash
mkdir stealth-testing-playwright
cd stealth-testing-playwright
bash create_structure.sh
```

### Phase 2: Add New Files (5 minutes)
Copy all 12 artifacts to their locations (see FILE_MANIFEST.md)

### Phase 3: Copy Original Files (5 minutes)
Copy 14 files from original repo (see list above)

### Phase 4: Create Modified Init File (1 minute)
Create new `src/runners/__init__.py` with only PlaywrightRunner

### Phase 5: Install & Test (10 minutes)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
export PROXY_HOST="84.200.91.70"
export PROXY_PORT="8083"

## üîó Next Steps After Playwright

Once Playwright repo is working:

1. **Test Selenium Category** (Option A continued)
   - 4 Selenium libraries
   - Similar structure
   - Different runner

2. **Test Specialized Category**
   - 4 specialized libraries
   - Mixed reliability
   - Advanced features

3. **Test Puppeteer Category**
   - 1 Node.js library
   - Requires package.json
   - Simplest repo

4. **Create Parent Index Repo**
   - Links to all 4 category repos
   - Comparison tools
   - Overall documentation
